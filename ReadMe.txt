Styling a Site with External CSS
Date:09/29/2020

In this assignment, external style sheet has been used to give styling to the existing
index.html. The instructor provided the index.html file with no styling. No changes were made 
in the html file. In other words, no chnages made inside the body tag of the html. 
File name pacific.css had the styling to this html page. 
See the pacific.css file for more comments about what each styling does.

Personally, the assignment was very time consuming since I'm still at the initial level
I was able to make most changes required to look the page similar to what the instructor provided.
However, I was not able to adjust the margin or padding of the text in the content part. I had no success
with that part even after consuming considerable amount of time on it.
